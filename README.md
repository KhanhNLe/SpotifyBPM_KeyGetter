Made this because I was tired of googling a song's key and bpm when practicing guitar. 
Uses Spotify's API Specifically (Web, and WebPlayback)

Usage:
Log into Spotify Developer Dashboard
Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Log in with your Spotify account credentials.
Select Your Application
If you haven't already created an application, you'll need to create one before proceeding.
After Creation
It should list Your
1. Client ID
2. View Secret ID to show your Secret ID

Setting Redirect URI
Go to your Spotify Developer Dashboard:
Log in to your Spotify Developer account.
Open your application settings.
Set the Redirect URI:
In your app settings, find the Redirect URIs section.
Add http://localhost:8888/callback (or any other appropriate URL) as your Redirect URI.

Edit the script via your favorite IDE:
Copy and paste the IDs into their respectively slot, including your Redirect URI

Save
Run Script
Look at Terminal, copy-paste link into google.com
Should ask for your authorization
I usually get a 404 page here, but that's okay just copy and paste the url after the 404 screen into terminal. 
Everything should work, if you have spotify installed already.
Have Fun Practicing!
